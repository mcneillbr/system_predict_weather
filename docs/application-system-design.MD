# Application Architecture

Nest.js is a framework for developing robust, modular services, allowing for code reuse and easy application maintenance. The framework has an internal module for scheduling and executing tasks in the background.

Building asynchronous applications to collect data from IoT devices becomes a simple task and runs in the background updating the database with the latest weather forecast information.

This flexible architecture makes it possible to create a variety of services, such as alerting farmers to changes in the weather that could affect their crops.


# Error and Exception Handling

Nest.js has an integrated exception layer that handles all unhandled exceptions in the application. This centralizes error handling and simplifies the code. An integrated, easily extensible logging system records all application activity, allowing problems to be analyzed and debugged.


# Application Security

Nest.js offers security features such as data validation, robust authentication and authorization, and protection against attacks such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF. This ensures that the application is protected against unauthorized access, invalid data, and vulnerabilities. It also has a large community of developers to fix bugs and security flaws in its ecosystem.

# Evolution and New Features for the Future

The application can be further developed by implementing a notification service integrated with the automatic weather data collection service. The notification service will use various communication channels such as email, SMS, and/or other channels. 

This service would inform farmers about climate change, which would help them make safer decisions about how to grow their crops. In addition, other enhancements and improvements could be implemented in the future, such as integration with third-party APIs, real-time data analysis, and machine learning.

# Conclusion

The Nest.js framework, along with various tools, provides an out-of-the-box architecture that allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, low-coupling, and easy-to-maintain applications.
The framework's structure simplifies exception handling, provides robust security, and allows for the creation of a variety of services.
In the future, the application could be expanded to include a notification service integrated with the automatic weather data collection system. This service can provide farmers with better indicators to make more confident decisions about growing their crops. It can also rely on third-party applications for real-time data analysis using machine learning. This makes the application more powerful and efficient.
